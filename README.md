Bank Project for Meow

Objective
Your objective is to build a full-stack application for a fake financial institution using a language of your choice, you may use an API framework of your choice if youâ€™d like.

Brief
While modern banks have evolved to serve a plethora of functions, at their core, banks must provide certain basic features. Today, your task is to build the basic webapp for one of those banks! Imagine you are designing an administrative application for bank employees. You should build a backend API that ultimately be consumed by multiple frontends (web, iOS, Android etc). 

Tasks
There should be API routes and functionality that allow them to:
Create a new bank account for a customer, with an initial deposit amount. A single customer may have multiple bank accounts.
Transfer amounts between any two accounts, including those owned by different customers.
Retrieve balances for a given account.
Retrieve transfer history for a given account.

Please return what you're able to accomplish before Monday at 11:59pm PST.
